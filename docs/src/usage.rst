   import lyricsgenius
   genius = lyricsgenius.Genius("my_access_token_here")
   artist = genius.search_artist("Andy Shauf", max_songs=3, sort="title")
   print(artist.songs)

There are various options configurable as parameters within the
:ref:`genius` class:

.. code:: python

   # Turn off status messages
   genius.verbose = False 

   # Remove section headers (e.g. [Chorus]) from lyrics when searching
   genius.remove_section_headers = True 

   # Include hits thought to be non-songs (e.g. track lists)
   genius.skip_non_songs = False

   # Exclude songs with these words in their title
   genius.excluded_terms = ["(Remix)", "(Live)"]

You can also call the package from the command line:

.. code:: bash

   export GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN="my_access_token_here"
   python3 -m lyricsgenius --help
